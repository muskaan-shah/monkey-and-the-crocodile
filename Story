once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a Monkey on the jamoon tree,which was on the banks of a river.
in the same forest, there lived a Crocodile and his wife. one day, the Crocodile came to the banks of the river 
and rested under the tree.the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. the Crocodile came back the next day
for more fruits, as he loved them. as days passed by, the Crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
